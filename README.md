# ZarinPal-Test
This Project built on MVVM architecture, Clean architecture and Single Activity

Used techs:

Dagger/Hilt (For dependency injection)

Navigation Component (For Navigating through fragments)

Jetpack compose (For building views)

Kotlin Coroutines (For multi threading and better performance)

Apollo-Client (For GraphQL requests, also implemented HttpCache for caching responses)

Glide (For loading images)

Room database (for local caching and offline-first approach)

Gson (for converting data classes)

** Used a button instead of tab layout to navigate between fragments, TabLayout had no challenge with Navigation component **
